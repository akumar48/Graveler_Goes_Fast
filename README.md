# RollerV2B

`rollerv2b.go` is a Go program that simulates rolling dice in sessions and collects statistical information. Specifically, this simulates the chances of Graveler surviving a really cursed softlock. This README provides instructions on how to run the program using the `go run` command.

## Prerequisites

- [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) installed (version 1.17 or later recommended).
- An internet connection to fetch any Go dependencies (if applicable).

## Running the Program

```bash
go run rollerv2b.go
